How I would approach the project after initial set up:
	0. BEFORE ANYTHING- have a better understanding of C
	1. I would load a single midi file and see if it can play thru the speakers before anything else (remote)
	2. Implement pause/play/stop functionality (remote)
	3. Implement switching between remote and local and making sure all functionality I had already completed
	   works in both modes
	4. Add more songs and make sure it plays the selected song
	5. Implement skipping songs (remotely and locally)

Things the class says:
	- Look at provided files and documentation
	- Investigate board features
	- How to configure pins
	- Read board documentation
	- Figure out how MIDI works
